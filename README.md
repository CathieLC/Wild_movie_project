# Wild_movie_project

This project aims at using the IMDb datasets to create a movie recommender system, and provide some analysis on the film industry as well, on some select KPIs, as part of the Wild Code School Data Analyst training.

The web page containing the recommender system and the analysis is available on [this page](https://share.streamlit.io/cathielc/wild_movie_project/main/app.py).

Please feel free to consult it and to play around with the recommender engine.

The data cleaning process is located in the data_cleaning.ipynb notebook, along with our concluding thoughts on the project. The source code for the recommender engine is located in the ml_cosine_algorithm.ipynb notebook.
