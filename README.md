# Movie Recommender Project

This project aims at using the IMDb datasets to create a movie recommender system, and provide some analysis on the film industry as well, on some select KPIs, as part of the Wild Code School Data Analyst training.

The web page containing the recommender system and the analysis is available on [this page](https://wild-movie-112021.herokuapp.com/) (it may take few seconds for the server to wake up at first).

Please feel free to consult it and to play around with the recommender engine.

The contributors to this project are:

- [Franck Joly](https://github.com/JOLYfranck)

- [Catherine Le Calve](https://github.com/CathieLC)

- [Josse Preis](https://github.com/jossepreis)

The data cleaning process is located in the data_cleaning.ipynb notebook, along with our concluding thoughts on the project. The source code for the recommender engine is located in the ml_cosine_algorithm.ipynb notebook.

If you would like to fork this project and run it locally, please install the requirements and run the script using this command at the root of the repository:
