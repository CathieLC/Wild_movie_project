    'There are some noticeable patterns here. During the 1920s and 1930s decades, most of the top 5 actors (when it comes to the sheer number of movies) were Japanese, with the notable exception of Sau-Nin Wong who lived in Hong Kong. The numbers are also on par with more recent decades, indicating a very prolific film industry in the Far East before the Second World War. This warrants deeper analysis, but it is worth reminding for now that a political context of extreme nationalism and regional conflict often means a heavy production of propaganda movies.'
